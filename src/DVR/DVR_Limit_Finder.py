DVR_Limit_Finder_1_4.py
=====================================================================
WHAT THIS FILE DOES
---------------------------------------------------------------------
General-purpose (system-agnostic) tool for mapping out WHERE the
smooth-potential DVR solver stops being trustworthy, by comparing
its output against a reference spectrum and searching for the
breakdown point in two complementary directions:

    (A) RESOLUTION LIMIT -- fix the number of energy levels n and the
        spatial span, then coarsen the grid (increase dx) until the
        error vs reference exceeds a tolerance. Finds the maximum
        grid spacing dx still trustworthy for n levels.

    (B) LEVEL-COUNT LIMIT -- fix a grid (span + dx, i.e. fixed
        computational cost) then grow the number of levels requested
        from that SAME grid until the error vs reference exceeds
        tolerance. Finds the highest state index that grid can still
        be trusted for, and now continues searching beyond the initial
        reference length when an extension function is provided.

Both searches work with ANY potential and ANY reference spectrum.

CHANGELOG (v1.3 -> v1.4)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- `find_maximum_levels` gains an optional `extend_reference_func`
  parameter. Previously, when the search reached the end of the
  supplied reference spectrum without finding a breakdown spike, it
  stopped and reported "capped by reference_length" -- leaving the
  plot with a flat floor and no visible cliff.

  With `extend_reference_func` provided, the search instead calls
  that function to compute additional reference levels on demand,
  then continues growing n all the way up to the grid's hard ceiling
  (num_points - 2). This guarantees the plot always shows the full
  error curve including the breakdown cliff, regardless of how many
  reference levels were pre-computed upstream.

  The callable signature is:
      extend_reference_func(n_needed: int) -> array_like
  where n_needed is the total number of reference levels required
  (not a count of extras). The function may compute them fresh each
  call; caching is the caller's responsibility.

  A mutable container (_ref) is used internally so the `evaluate`
  closure always references the latest (possibly extended) reference
  without needing nonlocal.

  If `extend_reference_func` is None (default), behaviour is
  identical to v1.3.

- `plot_level_limit_search` updated to annotate "Reference extended"
  in the plot title when the search used the extension function.

    """
    Find the RESOLUTION LIMIT of the DVR solver: the maximum grid
    spacing dx (equivalently, the minimum number of grid points) at a
    FIXED spatial span [x_min, x_max] for which all of the lowest
    `num_levels` eigenvalues stay within `tolerance` of the reference.

    WHY dx and not num_points?
    dx has a direct physical meaning: it is the length scale that sets
    the kinetic-energy cutoff of the DVR basis (~pi*hbar/(2*m*dx)^2)
    and determines how well the shortest de Broglie wavelength present
    at the highest requested energy level is sampled. Expressing the
    limit as a maximum dx therefore generalises immediately to new
    spans, new potentials, and new systems without reinterpreting a
    raw point count.

    Method:
        1. Find a fine anchor dx_start that verifiably passes (grow
           it downward automatically if the default does not pass).
        2. Geometrically grow dx by `grow_factor` until the error
           first exceeds `tolerance`.
        3. Binary-search in integer num_points space between the
           last-passing and first-failing point counts to pin the
           boundary to single-point precision, then convert back to dx.

    Parameters
    ----------
    potential_func : callable
        V(x), smooth (finite everywhere), passed through to the solver.
    num_levels : int
        Fixed number of energy levels tested at every grid density.
    x_min, x_max : float
        Fixed spatial span (only grid SPACING is varied here; a
        separate search would be needed to probe span/truncation
        effects independently).
    reference_energies : array_like
        Ground-truth energies, length >= num_levels.  Analytic or a
        finer numerical reference -- the function does not care which.
    tolerance : float, optional
        Maximum allowed error (in units of `metric`) to "pass"
        (default 1e-6).
    metric : str, optional
        One of "max_abs", "max_rel", "mean_abs", "mean_rel"
        (default "max_abs").
    mass, hbar : float, optional
        Physical constants passed through to the DVR solver.
    dx_start : float or None, optional
        Starting (fine, expected-to-pass) grid spacing. Defaults to
        span / max(8*num_levels, 200), which gives a generous starting
        density. Decrease this if the default anchor fails.
    grow_factor : float, optional
        Geometric growth factor applied to dx each step while
        searching for the coarse-grid breakdown point (default 1.15,
        meaning ~15% coarser per step -- fine enough to map the cliff
        well without excessive DVR calls).
    max_anchor_pts : int, optional
        Safety cap: the search will not go below dx = span/max_anchor_pts
        while looking for a passing anchor (default 200,000 points
        equivalent).
    verbose : bool, optional
        Print a one-line summary at the end (default True).

    Returns
    -------
    dict with keys:
        maximum_dx : float
            Coarsest grid spacing found that still passes tolerance.
            This is the primary, physically meaningful result.
        minimum_grid_points : int
            The corresponding number of grid points (derived from
            maximum_dx via the span).
        error_at_limit : float
            The error metric value at maximum_dx.
        capped_by : str
            "tolerance" if a genuine breakdown was found while
            coarsening, or "hard_floor" if the solver remained
            accurate all the way down to the smallest possible grid
            (num_levels + 2 points) without ever failing.
        trace : list of dict
            Every {"dx", "num_points", "error", "passed"} tested, in
            evaluated order. Feed this to `plot_grid_limit_search`.

        Fixed grid configuration (held constant throughout).
    reference_energies : array_like
        Initial ground-truth spectrum. Should ideally be at least

        `extend_reference_func` so the search can obtain more.
    tolerance : float, optional

    metric : str, optional

    mass, hbar : float, optional
        Physical constants passed through to the DVR solver.
    n_start : int or None, optional
        Starting level count (default max(2, num_points // 20)).
    grow_factor : float, optional
        Geometric growth ratio per step (default 1.3).
    verbose : bool, optional
        Print progress lines (default True).
    extend_reference_func : callable or None, optional
        If provided and the search reaches the reference ceiling

        The search then continues up to the grid's hard ceiling.

    Plot relative error vs grid spacing dx from a `find_minimum_grid_points`

    The x-axis runs from fine (small dx, left) to coarse (large dx,
    right), matching the natural reading direction: "anything to the
    left of the green line is safe". The y-axis shows the maximum
    relative error max|ΔEₙ/Eₙ| across all tested levels, so the
    safe flat floor is horizontal and easy to read regardless of how
    large the absolute energies are.

    Parameters
    ----------
    potential_func : callable
        V(x), smooth, passed through to both searches.

        Used in plot titles and console output.
    reference_energies : array_like
        Ground-truth spectrum (analytic or finer numerical). Shared by
        both searches. Should have at least
        num_points_for_level_search - 2 entries so search B is not
        artificially capped by reference length.
    num_levels_for_grid_search : int
        Fixed n for search A (the resolution-limit search).
    x_min, x_max : float
        Fixed span for both searches.
    num_points_for_level_search : int
        Fixed grid point count for search B (the level-count limit).
        Commonly the same grid used in the upstream DVR pipeline.
    tolerance : float, optional
        Shared error threshold (default 1e-6).
    metric : str, optional
        Shared error metric (default "max_abs").
    mass, hbar : float, optional
        Physical constants passed through to both searches.
    grid_search_kwargs : dict or None, optional
        Extra keyword overrides for `find_minimum_grid_points`
        (e.g. dx_start, grow_factor).
    level_search_kwargs : dict or None, optional
