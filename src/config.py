=====================================================================
Single source of truth for the current run's physical setup: the
potential, its constants, and the numerical control parameters.

This is exactly "Section 0" of Quantum_HO_Master.py, pulled out into
its own module so that OTHER scripts (the figures/ tools, tests, a
notebook, ...) can import the potential / bounds / parameters WITHOUT
importing Quantum_HO_Master.py itself -- which would otherwise run
the full six-section pipeline (DVR solve, reference generation, Cv
sweep, ...) as a side effect of the import.

To switch systems: edit `my_potential`, `SYSTEM_NAME`, and
`T_UNITS_LABEL` below (swap which block is commented out), exactly as
before. Nothing else in the repository needs to change.
